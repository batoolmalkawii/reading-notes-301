In today's blog, I am going to discuss some topics related to _web development_. So, _let's get started!_


### 1. Grids in CSS:
The CSS **Grid Layout** Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements.
An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.
* Example: 
```
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
}
```
