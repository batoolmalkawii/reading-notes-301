In today's blog, I am going to discuss some topics related to _web development_. So, _let's get started!_

## Node.js

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Basically, it a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.
It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
`npm`, a package manager that comes bundled with Node.

`.js` files use Node’s built-in console module to display a message in a terminal window.
Example: `node hello.js`

Node.js Has Excellent Support for **Modern JavaScript**. Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond.
As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. 
It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about _compatibility issues_ — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.

 Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v.

In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s **largest software registry***. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week.

#### Node.js use cases:
1. For anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.
2. Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server
