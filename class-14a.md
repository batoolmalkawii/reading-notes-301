In today's blog, I am going to discuss some topics related to _web development_. So, _let's get started!_


 ## Database Normalization:
 
 
 ##### - Introduction to Database Normalization:
 
   - Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
   - The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.
   - There are three normal forms most databases adhere to using.  
   
   
 ##### - Reasons for Database Normalization:
 
 
   - There are three main reasons to normalize a database:
     1. is to minimize duplicate data
     2. is to minimize or avoid data modification issues
     3. is to simplify queries.
     
     
  ##### - Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies:
  
  
    - Duplicated information presents two problems:
      1. It increases storage and decrease performance.
      2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.
      
 #####  - There are three modification anomalies that can occur:
    1.  - Insert Anomaly: ![link](https://www.essentialsql.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Intro-Insert-Anomaly.png)
    
        -There are facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row. 
    2. - Update Anomaly: ![link](https://www.essentialsql.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Intro-Update-Anomaly.png)
    
    3. - Deletion Anomaly: ![link](https://www.essentialsql.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Intro-Deletion-Anomaly-e1425554658757.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb2)
