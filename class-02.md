# Explore the Tech!
In today's blog, I am going to discuss several topics related to _web development_. So, _let's get started!_




### 4. Pair Programming:
Pair programing is a technique used to foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills, and it is used commonly in many agile work environments.
pair programming involves two roles: 
* Driver: the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Manages the text editor, switching files, version control, awriting—code.
* Navigator: uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
Using pai programming touches on all four skills (speaking, listening, reading and writing): _developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves._

The following are reasons _why_ you should do _pair programming_:
1. Greater efficiency.
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students.
4. Social skills.
5. Job interview readiness.
6. Work environment readiness.
